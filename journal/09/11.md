# Day 8

today, i want to push through what's left of the project and finally get it out of the way. i don't have much left, after all. im unsure if i'm including the report in what i have to do today but at worse i'll have it done tomorrow.

---

i added a function called `clean_data` that i'm going to fill in later. it's going to isolate the mapping operation from the raw data to the "clean" data that we will actually be using. i hope this is going to help with code clarity.

---

welp, i ended up implementing `clean_data` anyways.
