# Day 4

i think i forgot to link it yesterday, but i found this cool [example](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/showcase/firefox.html#sphx-glr-gallery-showcase-firefox-py) of the old firefox logo made with `PatchPath`.

seems i need to download the protobuf compiler to produce some sort of library for my python code, which will allow me to read the data i receive from the stm endpoint.

---

that was easy enough. simply needed to

- install the `protobuf-compiler` system package, which gives us access to the `protoc` command.
- use said command to compile the protobuf definitions found on day 2 like so: `protoc --python_out=. <filename>.proto`
- copy the resulting file in the project
- install the `protobuf` package with pip
