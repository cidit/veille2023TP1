# Day 10

i cant believe i stretched this thing over 15 days past when i had most of it done.

---

helped a few people! that was nice.

---

david's criterias:

- agregate data
- filter data over time or space
- visualier

---

added the `mypy` module which adds static type inference and lints to my editor! a lot of libraries don't have type stubs for it though, that's unfortunate.

i think mypy is the sort of tool that should be in every pythonista's toolbox. static type linting is simply that valuable.
