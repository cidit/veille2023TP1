# Day 6

i know that python uses a try-catch exception style of error handling but i've been redpilled by Rust's way of handling errors so im gonna look for a result type i can use in the package index, otherwise i'm probably going to make it myself :)
so far, this seems the most promissing: `https://pypi.org/project/result/`.
i also learned from this package that python now has an elegant match statement like in rust! nice!
