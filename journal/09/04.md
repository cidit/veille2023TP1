# Day 4

i think i figured it out. of all things, i think i simply needed to specify a minimum and a maximum value. i think what happened is that since everything was zeroes, it assumed that zero was both the max and min value.
im going to remove the casts to ints now, see if it changes anything. im also gonna reduce the vmax to 1. now i should get random values between 0 and 1 and they should all display different colors on the map.

i have it working for real now! the heatmap is functionning correctly!
