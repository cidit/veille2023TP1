# Day 5

i tried translating the coordinates from degrees to indices using `np.interp` but seems i dont have a good enough handle on numpy to do that so i will do it manually with a translate function.

---

nevermind, i made it work! i had to switch two parameters of place. now, i still have two issues:

- the x axis seems to be flipped on the heatmap
- the `PatchPath` seems to disapear after the first update.

---

i fixed the flipping by introducing a call to `np.flip`. i would like to fix the underlying cause but for now this is a good enough fix. next, i need to mess with the colors of my heatmap to introduce alphas. after that, i have to tweak the translation part of the update function to make it more accurate.

---

i feel like i'm missing shape data, because theres a lot of buses going outside of the shape defined...
maybe i just need to rotate instead of flipping? that's a TODO to investigate, but i dont think it breaks the project as its just a prototype after all. although, inaccurate data is not good.

---

i said i would wait and leave it as a todo but i ended up fixing the buses misalignment issue quickly. i was right: the array didnt need to be flipped, it needed to be rotated 90deg counter-clockwise. now the buses overlap with the roads properly!!

---

i went backwards... ironically, the colors are the worst roadblock i've faced for this whole project.
the weird bug where the screen becomes super wide is happening again, too.
