# Day 11

turns out `mypy` is more of a chore since its so badly supported. everything matplotlib is missing their type stubs. so now my code is filled with `# type: ignore` at the end of lines with incomplete `mypy` metadata.
i commend the mypy project but at this point might as well rewrite everything in a more typesafe language.

pretty much everything has been cleaned up with the exception of the update function. probably gonna make a curried factory for it.
