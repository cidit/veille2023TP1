# Day 2

bit of a late start to day two but oh well (its 11hPM)

---

im having a strange issue where my heatmap doesnt get updated anymore now that it's inital state is zeroes...

when i set `matrix` to random data, it works...

```py
matrix = np.random.rand(100, 100)
```

but when i set it to zeroes, it does not!

```py
matrix = np.shape((100, 100))
```

`np.random.rand` returns a `ndarray[Any, dtype[float64]]` wheras `np.shape` returns a `NDArray[Any, dtype[float64]]` (note: case sensitive) ... weird.

---

now, for some reason, im getting a cryptic `AttributeError: 'FuncAnimation' object has no attribute '_resize_id'`. nice.
