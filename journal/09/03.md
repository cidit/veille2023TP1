# Day 2

bit of a late start to day two but oh well (its 11hPM)

---

im having a strange issue where my heatmap doesnt get updated anymore now that it's inital state is zeroes...

when i set `matrix` to random data, it works...

```py
matrix = np.random.rand(100, 100)
```

but when i set it to zeroes, it does not!

```py
matrix = np.shape((100, 100))
```

---

`np.random.rand` returns a `ndarray[Any, dtype[float64]]` wheras `np.shape` returns a `NDArray[Any, dtype[float64]]` (note: case sensitive) ... weird.

---

now, for some reason, im getting a cryptic `AttributeError: 'FuncAnimation' object has no attribute '_resize_id'`. nice.

---

when i hover the plot, it stretches to the horizontal width of my monitor because any of the points holds a tiny float with an incredibly long amount of leading zeroes. i have no idea what could be causing this, and i am very confused...

---

THAT'S IT im done for today. i made zero progress and am extremely dissatisfied >:(

---

NVM i messed with it @ 3AM and managed to get *something* to work.
turns out the `_resize_id` error was somehow due to having an `init_func` in the call to `FuncAnimation`, but im not sure why. after that, i changed the type of the ndarrays to ints and it seems to have done the trick.

---

nvm again, i forgot to change the initial back to zeros and it doesn't work again... AND IT STILL SHOWS THE ABSURDLY LONG FLOAT VALUES ON HOVER DESPITE THE ARRAYS CONTAINING ONLY INTS WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
