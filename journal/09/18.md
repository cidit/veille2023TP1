i took quite a long break, but im still in advance. although, i hope i don't end up as the hare in the turtle and the hare story...

ive done a bit of research and it seems the better implementation of a queue that i want is called a `deque` from the `collections` module. i've replaced everything by it and hope it'll do the trick, but i won't hold my breath.
