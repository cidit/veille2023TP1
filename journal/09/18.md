# Day 9

i took quite a long break, but im still in advance. although, i hope i don't end up as the hare in the turtle and the hare story...

---

ive done a bit of research and it seems the better implementation of a queue that i want is called a `deque` from the `collections` module. i've replaced everything by it and hope it'll do the trick, but i won't hold my breath.

---

i've ajusted the code a little bit but it still doesnt work because im using the values im getting incorrectly. for example, im currently trying to rotate a 0 dimentions array. how did i manage that, i have no idea.
i think to facilitate the development, i should improve my typing. i can use type hints but this is where the limitations of python start making me uncomfortable.

---

i just realized that pandas dataframes are untyped. god damn it.

---

god, i hate python. the moment the program became a little more complex, it falls appart. making refactors in it is incredibly brittle, and i cant ever find myself using again it other than for teaching purposes, prototyping or exploring a dataset right now.

---

i forgot to mention it, but i've begun splitting my code for ease of reading and to separate concern, to make typing everything easier.
