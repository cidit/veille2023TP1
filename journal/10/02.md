# Day 13

im getting a weird `TclError: invalid command name ".!canvas"` that wasn't there yesterday, as proven by the fact that i have a `data/anim.gif` file. its very cryptic, but from what i understand it is caused because `plt.show()` destroys the plots when you quit it. why now?

---

i fixed it by making sure every plot was re-created after the `plt.show()` call. now it works as expected.

---

it works great but generating the GIF is excruciatingly long...
